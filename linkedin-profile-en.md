## About

I am an engineering leader, entrepreneur, and hands-on backend developer with over 20 years of experience. My career spans building products as an individual contributor, scaling high-performing teams, and leading organisations from early-stage startups to global enterprises.

I have delivered complex, high-availability systems, scaled engineering organisations during rapid growth, and built cultures where diverse, autonomous teams thrive. My technical work includes Java development, event-driven architectures, CI/CD automation, Kubernetes operations, and cloud-native delivery.

I am passionate about developing engineers into leaders, reducing process friction, and balancing speed with maintainability. My entrepreneurial ventures have strengthened my ability to connect product strategy with execution, from MVP to scale.

Today, I work as a developer to stay close to the technology while applying my leadership experience in mentoring, technical decision-making, and driving best practices within the team.
